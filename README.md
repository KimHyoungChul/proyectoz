# Proyectoz (System for Remote Tutoring)

ProyectoZ (System for Remote Tutoring) is a Project that pretends to shorten the distances between tutors and students what are interested in computer programming. In this application, students can report necessities of classes on specific subjects. The tutors can check the requests and satisfy them if they want. Once a tutor accepts a request, every member of the session can access a workspace. On it, users can communicate via chat and share resources. When a session of tutoring begins, the tutor can communicate with his audience via livestreaming. He also can use questions to assert the effectivity of the tutoring session.

This is the repository for the web app that composes ProyectoZ. This web app was developed using mainly Node.js and Express to handle the http requests. The media server, Kurento, uses WebRTC to enable livestreaming functionalities. Due to this, the app has an intensive use of websockets to enable other functionalities as well.
